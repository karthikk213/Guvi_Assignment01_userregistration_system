This is my first assignment in guvi D44 batch.

I created code using py3.0 and jupiter notebook. i uploaded both files

Defined each function and used according to user choice.

If user give 1 , then  Registraion function runs , where user should give correct email id according to rules given in assignment. if not user given correct format means, then code will not excute and print statement to start new registration and total stop executes.

Like this all functions is defined accoridng to assignment and tested plenty number of times.

data.txt file  where user email and password is stored.

thanks.
